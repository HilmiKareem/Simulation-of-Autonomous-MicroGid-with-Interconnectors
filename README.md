# Simulation-of-Autonomous-MicroGid-with-Interconnectors

This is my FYP that simulates the operational status at power level of a microgrid connected with 2 interconnectors. 

The protoype folders include all of the prior versions before the finalised and polished version is complete. 

The multi simulation folder includes the data and result from the multi simulation stithcing test that was conducted. 

The Parameter Sweep include the script used for each of the parameter sweep, should be noted the only difference to the final version is the parameter changed. 

The Excel Sheet named - Result Data Collection - is the data collected for the Result Section of the report

The Excel Sheet named - Test Plan & Verification - is the data collected for the unit test.
